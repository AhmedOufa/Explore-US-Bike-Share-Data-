# Explore US Bike Share Data 
In this project,i used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States[Chicago, New York City, and Washington]. i wrote a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. i also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
